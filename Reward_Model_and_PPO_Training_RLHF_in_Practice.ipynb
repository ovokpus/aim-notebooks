    "\n",
    "In practice, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback comes down to a few simple principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find, or create, a pretrained model. This can be instruct-tuned, or not, the options are overwhelmingly endless here!\n",
    "2. Collect Human Feedback for a specific task or collection of tasks.\n",
    "3. Train a \"preference\" or \"reward\" model using the collected human feedback data. The key insight here is that the reward model should output a *scalar* (single number, essentially) value in order to be integrated fully with existing RL strategies.\n",
    "3. Optimize the pretrained model against the reward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll come back to this idea in more depth - but first lets look at our model and see what could be improved."

    "Let's start with a brief overview of how this \"PPO\" thing works from the [`trl` repository](https://github.com/huggingface/trl):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Fine-tuning a language model via PPO consists of roughly three steps:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 🗣 **Rollout:** The language model generates a response or continuation based on query which could be the start of a sentence.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 🧪 **Evaluation:** The query and response are evaluated with a function, model, human feedback or some combination of them. The important thing is that this process should yield a scalar value for each query/response pair.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 💻 **Optimization:** This is the most complex part. In the optimisation step the query/response pairs are used to calculate the log-probabilities of the tokens in the sequences. This is done with the model that is trained and a reference model, which is usually the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. The KL-divergence between the two outputs is used as an additional reward signal to make sure the generated responses don't deviate too far from the reference language model. The active language model is then trained with PPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all a lot of text that can be boiled down to the following idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate tokens that could complete the sequences\n",
    "2. Check the scores of those tokens with our Reward Model\n",
    "3. Update our model based on the both the scores, and the logprobs of our policy and reference model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we are using *both* our quantization methods **and** LoRA!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's right, we can do RLHF with both which is what enables us to do this on a consumer card through Colab!\n"

Then, place a small piece of paper on the surface of the water. The ink will spread and appear to be written on the paper, but it's just a trick of the light.\\n\\n2. **Fake Sticky Note Messages**: Write a silly message on a sticky note and place it in a location where it's easy to find, like a friend's desk or a public place. When they find it, they'll think it's a real note from someone else.\\n\\n3. **The Invisible Writing Prank**: Write a message on a mirror or glass surface using a dry-erase marker. When the person tries to clean the surface, the message will disappear, leaving them wondering if they just imagined it.\\n\\n4. **Pen Swap**: Switch the pens of two people without them noticing. Watch as they try to figure out why their pen isn't working as usual.\\n\\n5. **The Fake Autograph**: Borrow a pen from someone and sign a fake autograph on a piece of paper or a photo. When they discover the forgery, they'll be surprised and amused.\\n\\n6\""
